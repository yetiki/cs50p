"""I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100â€¦

What is it?
It's 50! But what if it were more random?

This program:
- Prompts the user for a level, n. If the user does not input a
positive integer, the program prompts again.
- Randomly generates an integer between 1 and n, inclusive.
- Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive
integer, the program prompts the user again.
- If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program outputs 'Too
small!' and prompts the user again.
- If the guess is larger than that integer, the program outputs 'Too large!'
and prompts the user again.
- If the guess is the same as that integer, the program outputs 'Just right!'
and exits."""
